Predicting House Prices Based on Various Factors

Description: In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict house prices based on features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and market conditions. The model uses regression techniques to forecast housing prices and provide insights for real estate investors and homeowners.

Technologies Used: Python (pandas, NumPy), Matplotlib, Seaborn

Key Takeaways:
Cleaned and processed a large dataset for predictive modeling.
Applied feature engineering to improve model accuracy.
Visualized trends and patterns in housing prices.
