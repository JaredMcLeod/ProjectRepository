Hi! I am Jared McLeod, a data student with a passion for leveraging data science and machine learning to solve real-world problems. 
With expertise in predictive modeling, data visualization, and statistical analysis, I specialize in uncovering insights that drive decision-making and business growth.

I have experience working with a wide range of tools and technologies, including:

Python (pandas & NumPy)
R (ggplot2, ggraph, & tidyr)
Power BI
Tableau
One of my recent projects involves Predicting House Prices Based on Various Factors, where I applied regression techniques to forecast housing prices based on key features 
like location, size, and market trends. This project showcases my ability to work with complex datasets and deliver actionable insights for 
industries such as real estate and financial modeling.

I am continuously expanding my skill set, currently focusing on machine learning, deep learning, and advanced data analytics to help businesses solve their most pressing challenges. 
I am excited to apply my knowledge and experience to make an impact in the field of data science.
