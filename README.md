Overview
This project explores the use of TextBlob for performing sentiment analysis on text data. It also includes various text preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare data for analysis. The notebook walks through a series of steps, demonstrating how to convert raw text into meaningful sentiment scores, which can help understand the emotions expressed in the data.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Cleans raw text data by removing noise such as special characters, stop words, and punctuation.
Sentiment Analysis: Uses the TextBlob library to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
Data Exploration: Provides examples of real-world text data (e.g., reviews) to illustrate sentiment analysis in action.
Jupyter Notebook Format: Easy to follow with code, outputs, and explanations provided in an interactive format.
Installation
